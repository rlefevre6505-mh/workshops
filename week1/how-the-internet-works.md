#h1 what is a localhost?

localhost is the use of a local PC to host web data. This has a default IP address of 127.0.0.1. This type of connection is called a loopback, in which the client computer sends a request to itself, as it is alsa acting as the server.
This is in contrast to how websites are normally hosted, using a 3rd party remote host/virtual server.

#h1 What are nameservers, why are they needed?

Nameservers are specialised servers that translate familiar looking, human readable web addresses into a corresponding IP address.
These are needed in order to direct web traffic, as they act like a directory or phone book.

#h1 Describe client and server: making a request, receiving a response.

The client is the device being used to view or interact with the web, such as a PC accessing a website. The server is another (usually) specialised device that responds to the client in order to deliver data to the client. Servers can also store some information.
When the client sends a request such as a web address, the server will typically send a further request to a database to find the required data, then once the database responds, the respose will be sent on to the client. The client is then able to process the data.

#h1 What is a port? What’s the default port?

The port is a number that is designated to a protocol and acts like a physical port in that it defines the point in which data can be passed through. This is a "virtual netwerok endpoint", as it is where data is passed between a network and a local device. TYhis system allows efficiency because data of different types can be transferred via dedicated ports at the same time without interfering with each other.
The default port depends on the protocol being used and provides a standardised and automatic way for network services and applications to be accessed on ther computer.
